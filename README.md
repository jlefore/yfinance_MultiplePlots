# yfinance_MultiplePlots
- My goal with this project was to track a few ticker symbols since the market fell.  
- I generally didn’t care much about the market and rarely paid attention until I got interested in bitcoin. This interest came from doing a python project parsing and then summarizing bitcoin transactions from a CSV file for a CPA to prepare a 2021 tax return. He needed cost basis and sales information on all applicable transactions in 2021. Brokerage firms and custodians are not required to send 1099’s for bitcoin et al. holdings.
- I was shocked at how easy it is to download the data from yahoo finance and use the panda data frame and Matplotlib skills I have acquired to plot the data in several different methods. Python ceases to amaze how many various libraries are available to install.
- I learned about and found code for daily moving averages, exponential moving averages, Bolinger bands, Doji, and how to create Candles in a line plot.
- The plots I created are simplified compared to what a subscription-like YCharts would provide, but it’s free, fun, and gets the job done. I’m not a day trader.
